LegitCheck: AI-Powered Financial Safety for Indian Investors

LegitCheck is a mobile application built with Flutter that empowers Indian retail investors to combat financial fraud. It provides two core features: instant offline verification of SEBI-registered professionals and an AI-powered credibility check for corporate announcements using the Gemini API.

üåü Core Features
LegitCheck offers a powerful, two-in-one verification system to protect investors from common fraudulent activities.

1. Instant SEBI Verification
Instantly verify if any investment adviser, stock broker, or portfolio manager is officially registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Offline First: The verification works without an internet connection, using a comprehensive on-device database.

Multi-Language Support: Full support for English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Marathi.

Advanced Filtering: Easily filter results by professional category to find exactly who you're looking for.

2. AI Credibility Analysis
Paste any corporate announcement or news article into the app for an instant, AI-powered analysis.

Real-time AI Scoring: A secure back-end powered by the Gemini API provides a clear credibility score (High, Low, or Unverifiable).

Detailed Justification: The AI provides a clear, bulleted list of reasons for its score, helping users spot red flags, unrealistic claims, and promotional language.

Serverless & Scalable: The back-end is built as a serverless function on Google Cloud Run, ensuring it's fast and cost-effective.

This project uses a modern, cross-platform stack to deliver a robust user experience.
